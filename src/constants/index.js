export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a 4th-year B.Tech Computer Science student at JK Lakshmipat University, specializing in Full Stack Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I build scalable and user-focused web applications using MERN stack. I enjoy working in collaborative environments and constantly learning and innovating through real-world projects and hackathons.

Other than this I am passionate about dance, travel, journaling, swimming and reading as my hobbies.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am passionate about building modern and scalable full-stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, with hands-on experience in cloud storage (Amazon S3, Cloudinary, Filebase) and secure authentication (JWT, Firebase). I also work with Gen-AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to boost productivity and accelerate development.

I have worked on real-world projects including Kalakendra, a workshop booking platform with Razorpay payments, role-based dashboards, and media management, and Journey Craft, a travel planning web app with dual user roles, booking flows, and itinerary customization. These projects strengthened my expertise in the MERN stack, API development, authentication, and scalable UI/UX design.

Beyond development, I actively participate in innovation and leadership activities, including the Smart India Hackathon 2023 & 2024 and presenting Journey Craft at Aarohan’25. I am also involved in cultural events like dance and ramp walk, and have served as Organizing Head & Coordinator for major university fests such as Sabrang and HackJKLU.`;
